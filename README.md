These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Docker ([Docker Desktop comes with Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))

## Running the App <a name = "usage"></a>

Clone the repoisitory
```
git clone https://github.com/nathanjones4323/geospatial-portfolio-app.git
```

Navigate to the app's directory
```
cd geospatial-portfolio-app
```

Run the following in your terminal:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

> :warning: If you need to rebuild and run the container run this command
```
docker-compose up --force-recreate --build -d && docker image prune -f
```

If this is the first time you are running the app, it will take a few minutes for the data pipelines to finish running. You can check the status of the pipelines by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Once the pipelines have finished running (or if you are restarting the app), you can access the Streamlit UI at http://localhost:8501

## 🗒️ TODO <a name = "todo"></a>

- [ ] Fix truncating column name error ==> Postgres can only handle 63 characters for column names and this is causing duplicate column names
- [ ] Add CBSA data to the data pipelines
- [ ] Add a check to the data pipelines to see if the data has already run and if so, don't run it again
